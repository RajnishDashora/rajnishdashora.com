# About Section Copy

**I believe great technology is invisible—it's the foundation that lets people focus on what matters. Over the past decade, I've dedicated my career to building systems and teams that create this kind of leverage.**

**Leadership comes down to surrounding yourself with people smarter than you, giving them context and autonomy, then getting out of their way. At Gojek, I grew teams from a single engineer to cross-functional groups of 30+. The secret wasn't in managing—it was in creating environments where talented people could do their best work. Whether it was managing $800M in marketplace budgets or building platforms for 1500+ engineers, the technology was never the hard part. The hard part was aligning people around shared goals and maintaining that alignment through hypergrowth.**

**I've learned that the best technical decisions are rarely the most sophisticated ones. They're the ones that solve real problems for real people. At McKinsey, I learned to think from first principles. At Gojek, I learned to ship fast and iterate. At realfast, I'm applying both: building AI Assistants that actually help people work better, not just automate for automation's sake.**

**Here's what I've discovered matters most: sustainable pace beats heroic sprints, clear systems beat brilliant individuals, and compound growth beats hockey sticks. I've seen $30M saved not through dramatic rewrites but through consistent, data-driven optimisation. I've seen driver trust rebuilt not through marketing but through reliable, error-free incentive systems.**

**Beyond engineering, I'm a coach at heart. I've designed bootcamps for 50+ engineers because I believe the highest leverage work is helping others grow. I'm also a certified yoga instructor—a reminder that balance isn't just about work-life separation, but about approaching everything with presence and intentionality. I still code regularly because staying close to the craft keeps me honest.**

**Who should connect with me?**
- **Engineering leaders** navigating hypergrowth or platform strategy
- **Founders** building AI products or tackling complex marketplace problems
- **Teams** struggling with cloud costs, observability, or engineering productivity
- **Anyone** who believes technology should empower people, not just replace them

**I'm here for the conversations about building things that matter—whether that's scalable systems, high-performing teams, or sustainable practices. If you're working on hard problems with real impact, let's talk.**
