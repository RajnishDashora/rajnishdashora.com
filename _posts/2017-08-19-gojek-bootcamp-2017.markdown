Military has boot camps, why a transport, logistics and payments company? One of the most important factor of an organisation’s growth is professionalism. Being a professional requires hard work, intensive training and initialisation of basic principles in the depth of one’s instinct, hence boot camp.

If I had to write one line about boot camp- Idea is to work together and craft. Boot camp is simulation of real world in an ideal way, performing activities leading to illustrations for nuance of various aspects of life and work are part of the game. This helps entire camp understand how important it is to be able to work together and why it is important to have a good start with basics or rather I would say early game optimisation.

For those of who still feel that boot camp is more focused on activity rather outcomes. The outcome is ignition of a deep instinct in the participants towards problem solving. Along the way there are many more attributes being added to personality. The activities, way to perform them and the reactions get affected as an outcome of boot camp.

Ability to agree faster and move, intent of construction, thinking at different levels of abstraction, simulation and illustration of various situations which occur in real-time and playing various roles maintaining professional values are some boot camp highlights which are important aspects of crafting.

Having said that, If we can not work together and craft, we definitely have a problem to solve.
