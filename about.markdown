Hello, I am Rajnish! Working as VP of Engineering at [realfast](https://www.realfast.ai/).

In the dynamic landscape of tech, where chaos meets creativity, I've navigated through by transforming intricate challenges into streamlined solutions. My journey has taken me from the from engineering boots-on-the-ground at McKinsey & Company to leading innovative teams at Gojek and now steering the ship at realfast.ai, I've embraced the ever-evolving nature of technology. My journey is fueled by a passion for designing systems that not only work but work wonders, transforming businesses and enhancing user experiences.

At the heart of my work is the belief that technology is not just about solving problems but about unlocking potentialâ€”whether it's improving operational efficiencies, enhancing team dynamics, or pioneering new AI capabilities. My drive comes from seeing the tangible impacts of these solutions: teams that thrive on collaboration, products that lead markets, and businesses that achieve unprecedented scalability.

Looking forward to connect, collaborate, and share insights from a journey filled with learning, adapting, and innovating. Let's explore how we can drive the future of technology together, one solution at a time.
